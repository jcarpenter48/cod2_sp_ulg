Copy these files, and your dll of choice renamed to d3d9.dll if you'd like to use software rendering, to your Call of Duty 2 folder where the executable is located. 

Launch using the provided shortcut to the .bat file.

To play on unsupported card, we use SwiftShader 3.2 (compiled by guy on ReactOS forums)
or Swiftshader 3.0 (compiled by MegaFox on Vogons)






Alternatively, you can do the following:

Launch with shortcut formatted like this: 
"C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty 2\CoD2SP_s.exe" +set com_introplayed 1 +exec autoexec.cfg

After launching, we enter console (make sure it's enabled) and type:
thereisacow 1337 (if you use seta this might be unnecessary)

Then enter the map you want to enter into console like so:
spdevmap libya

Once the map is loaded, open console and do exec autoexec.cfg or autoexec_infantry.cfg
this file contains the low graphics commands, some of which only work with devmode cheats on (above)

Tweak LOD settings as needed:
r_lodbias
r_forceLod
r_lodScale

Enjoy
